Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  "      3       4     1

The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.”The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, “One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.”there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability."      3       4     1

He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink."      3       4     1

Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn’t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback."      1       3     2

But the old man hasn’t seen the land in a really long time. The man don’t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn’t know what to do.      1       2     1

He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he’ll surely abide by: follow the map!"      3       6     3

When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.” I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit “ This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn’t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist."      3       2    -1

After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an “ramshackle shed” he became troubled , as he “had been “hitting“ his “water bottles regularly“ and was traveling through the “desert of California in June” and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “manuevered” his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling."      2       4     2

When he did one town, it was more of a “ghost town”, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   "      2       3     1

When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."      3       4     1

For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can’t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him.

One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me”. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."      3       4     1

For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don’t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way"      2       4     2

One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park."      2       4     2

The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next “town” he hits doesn’t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn’t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief."      3       4     1

Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."      2       3     1

When he gets to the first town he’s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he’s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map.

Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2°@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"". Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around.

With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement.

For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled “ I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ” This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said “ if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.”  "      2       4     2

At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.”  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The “heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.” I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. “Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water."      3       4     1

The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.      2       4     2

First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally.

The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. “The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip.

One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.      1       4     3

One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That’s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road.

Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another."      3       4     1

The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist."      3       4     1

One way is that if it’s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don’t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.      1       2     1

The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there’s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist"      3       4     1

This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory.

First, when he arrived at the first “town” and said, “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn’t so mild. He says, “The sight was troubling.” Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn’t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch’s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it."      1       4     3

Third, there is not any civilization on the “shortcut” he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with.

The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.” Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."      3       4     1

For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.      1       2     1

As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.

I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink.

He says “wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.” The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat.

The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere.

For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in.

Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn’t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn’t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch’s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved.

Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn’t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water."      2       4     2

Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.      1       2     1

He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey."      3       4     1

The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist."      2       3     1

I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven’t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.      3       2    -1

And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.      2       4     2

The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back.

He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch’s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took.

For example; the author states “I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view”. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it affected her."      3       4     1

But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse."      3       4     1

He seemed to wish he hadn’t taken the “shortcut” that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state.

But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.      1       3     2

But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.      1       2     1

First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, “I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.” This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition’s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be."      1       4     3

For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point."      3       4     1

One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirge.” shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist."      2       4     2

The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist’s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature."      3       4     1

He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can’t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.      1       2     1

For example, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, “through the high deserts of California in June.” This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder."      2       4     2

The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination.

The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination.

If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked “brackish.” So, setting can break a cyclist."      2       4     2

One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand.

The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. "      3       4     1

He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn’t even no where he was goin.      1       2     1

For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, “and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as, “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule.” Was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival."      2       4     2

The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph” This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch’s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."      3       4     1

One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."      3       4     1

At first it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.  "      2       4     2

The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in “one ramshackle shed…and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is."      1       4     3

For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it."      2       2     0

One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next."      1       2     1

The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn’t able to drink much because he had limited water.      1       4     3

In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood."      1       2     1

The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud."      2       4     2

If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful."      2       4     2

Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. “that mood” was replaced by short, moving hills.” The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, “@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.” There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour.

The cyclist was very hot. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.      3       3     0

Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up. and take alot of work of pedling off his hands.      1       2     1

Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. “ and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June”(Kurmaskie @NUM1).

He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn’t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him.

First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn’t even have any cool water. As the character says, “…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn’t help him either. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn’t take anyone’s advice."      3       4     1

If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would’ve lasted longer and he would’ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would’ve died. Luckily though it wasn’t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could’nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I’ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. "      3       4     1

It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult.

He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the “fork of sorts” as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn’t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink!

A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road."      2       2     0

Also, there weren’t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn’t anyone to help him. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist."      2       3     1

First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life."      2       2     0

First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead.

First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a ‘short cut” that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  "      3       4     1

First, he was in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over “one long, crippling hill.” From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you’re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride."      2       4     2

In the text it says “Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees” this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.” This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out.

The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink.

For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn’t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.      1       2     1

When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him."      2       3     1

He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don’t have to bike in that terrain.  "      2       2     0

The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist."      2       3     1

The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn’t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won’t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him."      3       3     0

The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.      3       2    -1

One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke”, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn’t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist."      2       2     0

For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building.

The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.      3       4     1

And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough."      3       3     0

He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier."      1       4     3

One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water.

He followed the ‘short cut’ that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. “There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."      2       4     2

It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This spasked his black humor The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he  could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind. ""This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive.

One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot."      3       3     0

This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive.

So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint."      1       2     1

For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.” These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.” He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.      2       3     1

The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny “old codgers” and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn’t the least bit established anymore, he’s slightly disappointed, but sees it as “a test of [his] inner spirit.” At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing "      1       4     3

This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn’t had in the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades.

Also the land is very hot because it says “…in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up.

First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal.

The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, “There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.” This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."      3       4     1

Soon, though the terrain changed. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion."      2       4     2

The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting."      3       4     1

It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he’d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him."      3       4     1

The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. “I hung my head,” means that he was depressed.

The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn’t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn’t trust old men anymore. They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.      2       2     0

First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly “(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."      3       3     0

First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke."      2       4     2

There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody’s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he’s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody’s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let’s say that he gets lost and he’ll need direction to get wherever he’s going well there’s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. "      2       2     0

This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.      1       4     3

Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.” Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.” The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, “ success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees."      3       3     0

He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day."      2       4     2

The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he’d be okay, but he regretted it later on"      2       4     2

In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey.

There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story."      3       4     1

First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn’t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  "      3       3     0

First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on."      2       2     0

For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ''Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s journey.

It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn’t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.      1       3     2

The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn’t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist."      3       4     1

I believe this because when it’s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example"      2       2     0

The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time.

For example in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June…” There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.      1       4     3

After that because you don’t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office.

For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like “battery acid”. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed."      2       4     2

For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.      2       2     0

First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. "      3       4     1

The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. "      1       3     2

The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into “short, rolling hills,” These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The horizon was what kept cyclist going. “I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.’ The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it."      3       4     1

Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst.

When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst.

One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature."      3       3     0

A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills.

But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."      3       4     1

Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. “I was going to die,” he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it’s the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe.

After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid.” With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water-depleting @NUM3.” eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions."      3       4     1

He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get rough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn’t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more threatening too, “a ridiculously large shake.” The landscape changes with the state of water."      3       4     1

Another example is when it says “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned."      3       4     1

Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him.

The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist.

He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn’t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways."      3       2    -1

And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road.

673   "In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important for character development.  "      3       2    -1

For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, “At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of “old-timers.” From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, “About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first “town”, a ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to heat down,” This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood."      3       4     1

In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride."      1       3     2

Then he didn’t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.      2       2     0

This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, “over one crippling hills…” with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn’t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he’ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water."      2       4     2

The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car.      2       3     1

I’m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke."      3       4     1

One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.      1       3     2

Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said “the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.” The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more.

You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don’t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me.      2       2     0

It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.      2       3     1

The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can’t get water is a major issue.      1       3     2

The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.      2       0    -2

After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.” In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting.

The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."      3       3     0

This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."      3       2    -1

The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.      1       2     1

I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This shows how he is doubtful.

When he started that ride, he was confident that the “old timers” were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says” The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.” He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth” just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon “ Gary and wilber’s fish camp best bet” then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."      3       4     1

He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.      1       2     1

At first he is fine riding along the old-timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn’t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. He wasn’t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting."      3       4     1

Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death."      3       2    -1

The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades”. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst”,. But the bumpy terrain didn’t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”.

This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."      2       4     2

He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless.

It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.

Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed.

For example in the story he says “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate”. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it’s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot."      2       4     2

The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid."      1       3     2

He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water.

Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting."      2       4     2

In the @LOCATION1, where it’s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He’s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch’s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again."      3       4     1

I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved."      3       4     1

One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist."      2       3     1

At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat.

First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions."      3       4     1

The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try’s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn’t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.

This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.

Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn’t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood."      3       3     0

The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.      2       3     1

In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip      2       3     1

Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example “Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story."      1       2     1

First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it’s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…”(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages."      2       3     1

He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.” I’d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning.

The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.      1       2     1

Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.      1       3     2

Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn’t  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in      1       2     1

First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."      3       4     1

Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the distance of his ride.

After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch’s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination.

In the story I just read he didn’t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.      2       2     0

For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can’t and they shouldn’t do this or that such as the sign of “no entering” or “one way”. Second, it’s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn’t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit”. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  "      1       2     1

In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean” As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state."      3       4     1

When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June” this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal."      3       4     1

You could tell he says “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.” He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going.

When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again.

The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “…Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…”. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure."      3       4     1

Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it’s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply."      2       4     2

The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me.""

The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss.

Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted."      3       4     1

When she entered the first town, “this sight was troubling”. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, “she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. “ The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, “Gary and wilbers fish camp”. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."      2       3     1

The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."      3       4     1

It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.      2       2     0

The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump “black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions."      3       3     0

The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town.

The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   "      1       3     2

At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.      3       3     0

In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.      1       4     3

The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, “by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, “@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in."      2       3     1

There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically.      2       2     0

The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “ From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part."      2       3     1

I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around.

For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.      2       4     2

He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.      1       3     2

He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn’t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come"      2       2     0

The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states “I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June”. To disappointed the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal."      3       2    -1

As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc."      3       4     1
